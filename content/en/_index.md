Welcome to my webpage! I'm an engineer and musician, passionate about music, mathematics and computer science.
I'm especially interested in the building and use of digital tools for artistic creation.

I defended [my Ph.D. thesis](https://www.theses.fr/s267227), then worked as a research engineer, at Sorbonne Universit√©, at [LAM](http://www.lam.jussieu.fr/). Before that, I graduated from the Centrale Paris general engineering school. I'm currently working as a research engineer at [LAM](http://www.lam.jussieu.fr/), where I carry on my work on vocal synthesis. Besides, I play the violin and the piano, I sing and make music on my computer.

You can see my projects on [Github](https://github.com/glocq), and listen to a few of my compositions on [my Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4X_Sho9tdLGUgJI4QmOMSw) or [my Soundcloud profile](https://soundcloud.com/eigensandwich). If you happen to wonder about the music that I listen to myself, feel free to check out [my long Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1gIvCptvejJjQC9xfNfI5B?si=def56ffe97f04b9e).

I'm looking for a job right now! I would like to work as an engineer on digital projects pertaining to artistic creation in the broad sense (not necessarily music!). Feel free to send me an email at *gregoireloc (at) gmail.com* (in French, English, or German). You can also find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gr%C3%A9goire-locqueville-8817a883).
