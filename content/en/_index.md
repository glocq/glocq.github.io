Welcome to my webpage! I'm an engineer and musician, passionate about music, mathematics and computer science.
I'm especially interested in the building and use of digital tools for artistic creation.

I'm currently working as a fullstack developer (Haskell, Purescript) at [ISC-PIF](https://iscpif.fr/?lang=en), in Paris, on the [Gargantext](https://iscpif.fr/projects/gargantext/?lang=en) project. I hold a Ph.D. in engineering from Sorbonne Université, where I worked on [gesture-controlled vocal synthesis](https://www.theses.fr/s267227), and an engineering degree from École Centrale Paris. Besides, I play the violin and the piano, I sing and make music on my computer.
