<p><em>April 28, 2025</em></p>
<p><em>This post is the first of a two-part series that describes my computer-assisted
solution to a physical puzzle I got. In this first part, I describe the problem
and model it in Haskell. This post is a little verbose, so feel free to skip
directly to <a href="https://glocq.github.io/en/blog/20250505/">part II</a>, where we'll see how to tell our computer to
actually solve the puzzle.</em></p>
<p>I got gifted a puzzle recently, allegedly a &quot;very hard one&quot;. After receiving it,
I spent a couple minutes trying to solve it, but it quickly became clear that,
unless there was a trick I'd missed, I didn't have the right combination of
patience and brainpower for that. I had some family and friends try to solve it
too, and although some of them displayed an impressive amount of persistence,
none was persistent enough to crack the puzzle either.</p>
<p>You know who else is incredibly persistent? My computer. It's not nearly as smart
as the humans around me and I, but it makes up for that in speed and tirelessness.
So if I manage to tell it exactly what to do, it might be able to find a solution.
Let's try!</p>
<p><em><a href="/documents/wooden_puzzle.lhs">The source for this post and the next</a> is a literate Haskell file. This means

<p><em>The following pieces of code are here to tell the Haskell toolchain how exactly
to interpret the file, and what our dependencies and imports are. I'll also
update them based on what I import in the second post.</em></p>

<h2 id="the-puzzle">The Puzzle</h2>
<p>Here's what the puzzle looks like:</p>
<img src="/images/puzzle.jpg" alt="A wooden box, with a bunch of wooden pieces scattered inside it and next to it" width="320"/> 
<p>Its principle is fairly simple: it's composed of 25 identical wooden
pieces, and a 5x5x5 cubic box. To solve the puzzle, one needs to pack the pieces
into a 5x5x5 cube, without holes nor chunks dangling out, so that it fits into
the box.</p>
<p>Here's what a single piece looks like: it's a 4x1x1 trunk, with a 1x1x1 cubic
notch poking out from one side:</p>
<img src="/images/puzzle_piece.svg" alt="Simple rendering of a piece composed of a few cubes put together" width="320"/> 
<p>The puzzle is easy enough to understand, and the fact that it's basically all
composed of cubes hints at the discrete nature of the problem, suggesting that
it would lend itself well to an algorithm search. Exactly how to model the
situation may not be completely obvious, though. We'll start setting the scene
by modeling space itself, then we'll talk about individual pieces, first in
isolation, then in the context of the whole puzzle. Along the way, we will need
a bit of math; I'll do my best to explain theoretical notions as we encounter them.</p>
<h2 id="first-steps-modeling-our-problem">First Steps Modeling our Problem</h2>
<p>Since we're dealing with things that all ultimately decompose into 1x1x1 cubes,
we can think of space as a grid of voxels (the 3D equivalent to a pixel) with
integer coordinates. Mathematically, a position in that space is a vector with
three integer coordinates<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The <code>linear</code> library provides the <code>V3</code> type constructor for vectors of three
coordinates; the type of positions will thus be <code>V3 Int</code>.</p>
<p>Since the box has dimensions 5x5x5 voxels, we'll say it contains all voxels whose
coordinates are of the form <code>V3 x y z</code>, where <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> range from 1 to 5.</p>
<p>Since all pieces are identical, we can get away with modeling just one &quot;generic
piece&quot;, with arbitrary position and orientation. Every other piece can then be
recovered simply by moving this &quot;blueprint&quot; around. We'll pick the disposition
such that the piece's trunk extends from coordinates (0, 0, 0) to (0, 0, 3), and
its notch is located at (0, 1, 2). We model that generic piece by simply
providing the list of coordinates of the voxels that compose it:</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-haskell "><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">genericPiece </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">::</span><span> [</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">V3 Int</span><span>]
</span><span>genericPiece = [ </span><span style="color:#d08770;">V3 0 0 0</span><span>, </span><span style="color:#d08770;">V3 0 0 1</span><span>, </span><span style="color:#d08770;">V3 0 0 2</span><span>, </span><span style="color:#d08770;">V3 0 0 3</span><span>, </span><span style="color:#d08770;">V3 0 1 2</span><span> ]
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now let's tackle the hard part: describing the ways a piece can be arranged
inside the box.</p>
<p>Mathematically, the ways that an object may be moved around in space can be
described by specifying a rotation around the origin, and a translation.
A 3D rotation around the origin can be encoded by a 3x3 matrix, and a
translation, by a 3-component vector:</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-haskell "><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#b48ead;">data </span><span style="color:#d08770;">Disposition </span><span>= </span><span style="color:#d08770;">Disposition

</span><span>  } </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">deriving </span><span style="color:#d08770;">Show
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now, for a given disposition of a piece, we need a way to get the coordinates
of the cubes that compose the piece. To do that, we just apply the rotation and
the translation to each cube of the generic piece.</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-haskell "><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">dispositionCoordinates </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">:: Disposition -&gt;</span><span> [</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">V3 Int</span><span>]
</span><span>dispositionCoordinates disposition = fmap applyTransform genericPiece
</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">where
</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#65737e;">-- Note that we are applying the translation after the rotation. We could
</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#65737e;">-- technically apply the the translation first, but I think it makes

</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#65737e;">-- translate it. In the end, what matters is that we stick to our convention.
</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">applyTransform </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">:: V3 Int -&gt; V3 Int
</span><span>  applyTransform vector =
</span><span>    translation disposition + (rotation disposition !* vector)
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="our-action-plan-to-enumerate-all-dispositions">Our Action Plan to Enumerate All Dispositions</h2>
<p>The <code>Disposition</code> datatype is able to represent any possible disposition of a
piece in the box. What we'll need to solve the puzzle is to enumerate all
those dispositions, but if we try to do so, we'll run into two problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not all values of type <code>Disposition</code> actually correspond to a valid disposition:
<ul>
<li>The <code>rotation</code> field is of type <code>M33 Int</code>, but not all <code>M33 Int</code> matrices
correspond to rotations: some of them encode transforms that mirrors their
input, others, to transforms that inflate it, and others do weirder stuff yet.</li>
<li>Even in cases where the <code>rotation</code> field actually encodes a rotation, the
specific disposition encoded by a given <code>Disposition</code> might not fit in the
box.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>Disposition</code> datatype is infinite (ignoring technicalities): it has fields
of type <code>V3 Int</code> and <code>M33 Int</code>, which both have <code>Int</code> coefficients, and <code>Int</code>
is infinite. So even if we wanted to list all possible <code>Disposition</code>s, we couldn't.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fortunately, it turns out that there are only finitely many possible dispositions,
so there's still hope that we might be able to list them all. Directly enumerating
them would be too difficult, though, so we will decompose the task:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, we'll make up a list of <em>candidate dispositions</em>. This list will have two
important properties:
<ul>
<li>Any <em>valid</em> disposition will appear in the list, even though the list might
still (and will) feature invalid ones.</li>
<li>The list will be finite, so we'll be able to enumerate it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then we'll define a predicate on dispositions, that is, a function of type
<code>Disposition -&gt; Bool</code>, which will tell us — this time with certainty —
whether a given disposition is valid.</li>
</ol>
<p>To get the full, exclusive list of valid dispositions, we'll then just need to
filter out invalid dispositions from the list of candidate ones.</p>
<img src="/images/puzzle_venn.svg" alt="Simple rendering of a piece composed of a few cubes put together" width="320"/> 
<h2 id="enumerating-candidate-dispositions">Enumerating Candidate Dispositions</h2>
<p>A <code>Disposition</code> has two fields; let's look at each of those in detail. First,
the <code>rotation</code> field. <code>rotation</code>s are encoded by a value of type <code>M33 Int</code>.
As we saw earlier, though, not all values of that type encode a rotation. Is
there a simple way to narrow <code>M33 Int</code> down to an easily enumerated collection?
There is!</p>
<p>To do that, we first need to talk a bit about what the coefficients of a 3x3
matrix represent. Say you have a 3D linear transform, and you want to write down
the matrix <em>M</em> that corresponds to it (in the standard coordinate system with axes
X, Y and Z). The first thing you do is apply the transform to the X axis. You
end up with a vector that is no longer necessarily aligned with the X axis;
instead, it has components along the X, Y and Z axis. The coefficients on the
first row of the <em>M</em> correspond to how much of each of the three axes appear in
our transformed X axis. Then the second row correspond to the same, but starting
with the Y axis, and the third row, to the Z axis.</p>
<p>That's for a general linear transform. But we're dealing with the much more
specific case of rotations in a voxel world. If you think a bit about what happens
in you rotate one of the three axes when you rotate it in that context, you'll
find that it either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remains unchanged.</li>
<li>Gets flipped.</li>
<li>Turns into another axis.</li>
<li>Turns into the flipped version of another axis.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all four cases, the corresponding matrix row will contain a 1 or a -1
coefficient for the resulting axis, and a 0 coefficient elsewhere. This means
that if we enumerate all possible matrices with coefficients -1, 0 and 1, we'll
get all valid rotation matrices! We do so using Haskell's handy syntactic sugar
for <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/List_comprehension">list comprehension</a>:</p>

</span><span>  ]
</span></code></pre>
<p>Again, keep in mind that this list contains many matrices that do <em>not</em>
correspond to valid rotations. But all valid rotations do appear in it.</p>
<p>Now we'll need to narrow the possible translations down into a finite list too.
The following paragraph is my attempt at explaining somewhat rigorously how we
do that; it's a little convoluted, but the general idea is fairly intuitive:
we care only about dispositions that fit in the box, so we can rule out any
disposition that translates the <code>genericPiece</code> too far away.</p>
<p>Ok, now here's the &quot;rigorous&quot; explanation: the <code>V3 Int</code> type is able to encode
arbitrarily long translations, but we're only interested in those that keep
the piece in our 5x5x5 box. Taking a look at the <code>genericPiece</code> above, remark
that it contains the cube at the origin, <code>V3 0 0 0</code>. Regardless of the rotation
matrix we apply, it will leave that cube unchanged. This means that only
the <code>translation</code> field impacts the origin cube. In other words, in any piece
given by a value of type <code>Disposition</code>, the coordinates of the cube
corresponding to the <code>genericPiece</code>'s cube at the origin are exactly the
<code>translation</code>'s field coordinates. Since we want all the cubes in our piece to
fit in the box, all coefficients must be between 1 and 5. So we can rule out
any disposition whose <code>translation</code> field features coefficients outside that
range, and we can finitely enumerate a list of candidate translations:</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-haskell "><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">candidateTranslations </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">::</span><span> [</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">V3 Int</span><span>]
</span><span>candidateTranslations = [ </span><span style="color:#d08770;">V3</span><span> x y z | x &lt;- [</span><span style="color:#d08770;">1</span><span>..</span><span style="color:#d08770;">5</span><span>], y &lt;- [</span><span style="color:#d08770;">1</span><span>..</span><span style="color:#d08770;">5</span><span>], z &lt;- [</span><span style="color:#d08770;">1</span><span>..</span><span style="color:#d08770;">5</span><span>] ]
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now that we have an enumeration of candidates for each of <code>Disposition</code>'s fields,
we can put them together to get a list of candidate <code>Disposition</code>s:</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-haskell "><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">candidateDispositions </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">::</span><span> [</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">Disposition</span><span>]
</span><span>candidateDispositions =
</span><span>  [ </span><span style="color:#d08770;">Disposition</span><span> rot trans | rot   &lt;- candidateRotations
</span><span>                          , trans &lt;- candidateTranslations ]
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="filtering-out-remaining-invalid-dispositions">Filtering Out Remaining Invalid Dispositions</h2>
<p>Now on to filtering out the remaining invalid dispositions! First we'll weed out
invalid rotations. We don't need to get into the details here, but it turns out
there's an easy way to tell whether a given 3x3 matrix encodes a rotation: a 3x3
matrix <em>M</em> encodes a rotation exactly when it is part both of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_group">orthogonal linear group</a> and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_linear_group">special linear group</a>.
In more concrete terms, this means <em>M</em> fulfils the following two conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>M</em> multiplied by its transpose is the identity matrix.</li>
<li><em>M</em>'s determinant is 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>In Haskell, this translates to:</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-haskell "><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#65737e;">-- | Does the given matrix encode a rotation?
</span><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">isRotation </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">:: M33 Int -&gt; Bool
</span><span>isRotation matrix = ((transpose matrix !*! matrix) == identity) &amp;&amp;
</span><span>                    (det33 matrix == </span><span style="color:#d08770;">1</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>We're almost done describing all possible dispositions! We know what a valid
rotation looks like, now the one problem we might still have is a piece arranged
in such a way that it doesn't fit in the box. That's easy, we just need to check
that each cube of the piece fits in the box:</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-haskell "><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">pieceFitsTheBox </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">:: Disposition -&gt; Bool
</span><span>pieceFitsTheBox disposition =
</span><span>  all cubeFitsTheBox (dispositionCoordinates disposition)
</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">where</span><span> cubeFitsTheBox :: </span><span style="color:#d08770;">V3 Int </span><span>-&gt; </span><span style="color:#d08770;">Bool
</span><span>        cubeFitsTheBox (</span><span style="color:#d08770;">V3</span><span> x y z) = x &gt;= </span><span style="color:#d08770;">1</span><span> &amp;&amp; x &lt;= </span><span style="color:#d08770;">5</span><span> &amp;&amp;
</span><span>                                    y &gt;= </span><span style="color:#d08770;">1</span><span> &amp;&amp; y &lt;= </span><span style="color:#d08770;">5</span><span> &amp;&amp;
</span><span>                                    z &gt;= </span><span style="color:#d08770;">1</span><span> &amp;&amp; z &lt;= </span><span style="color:#d08770;">5
</span></code></pre>
<p>And a valid disposition is one whose <code>rotation</code> field is actually a rotation,
and which results in a piece that fits in the box:</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-haskell "><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">isValidDisposition </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">:: Disposition -&gt; Bool
</span><span>isValidDisposition disposition = isRotation (rotation disposition) &amp;&amp;
</span><span>                                 pieceFitsTheBox disposition
</span></code></pre>
<p>Putting it all together, we get a list of all valid dispositions by starting from
the list of candidate dispositions and filtering out invalid ones:</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-haskell "><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">allValidDispositions </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">::</span><span> [</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">Disposition</span><span>]
</span><span>allValidDispositions = filter isValidDisposition candidateDispositions
</span></code></pre>
<p>We're pretty much done for this first blog post, but I'd like to prepare for the
next one with one last step: our <code>Disposition</code> datatype served us well, but all
we will need now to solve the puzzle is the actual coordinates of the cubes that
compose the pieces. So we'll convert it all to coordinates:</p>

<p>Phew! That was a little tedious, but now everything's in place for next part,
where we'll leverage Haskell's conciseness to actually solve the puzzle in a very
elegant way. See you then!</p>

<p><em>Pedantic note: Mathematically speaking, a vector cannot have integer
coordinates. The coordinates of a vector must take values in a field,
and integers do not form a field, only a ring. The technical term for
&quot;vector space&quot;-like objects over something that's only a ring is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics)">module</a>.
Of course this lexical matter has absolutely no consequence on the rest,
so we'll keep talking about &quot;vectors&quot;.</em></p>
