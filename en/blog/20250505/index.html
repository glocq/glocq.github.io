<p><em>May 5, 2025</em></p>
<p><em>This post is the second of a two-part series that describes my computer-assisted
solution to a physical puzzle I got. You will probably want to read the beginning
of <a href="https://glocq.github.io/en/blog/20250428/">part I</a> to understand what the puzzle is about, but other
than that this post is pretty self-contained :)</em></p>
<p>Last time we defined a list <code>allValidPieces</code> of all the ways that a piece may
be fitted in the box. Its type is the nested list <code>[[V3 Int]]</code>, because we
represent a single piece as a list of the voxels that compose it. Looks like
we're going to deal with lots of nested lists... Let's try to prevent confusion
by defining a type synonym:</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-haskell "><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#b48ead;">type </span><span style="color:#d08770;">Shape </span><span>= [</span><span style="color:#d08770;">V3 Int</span><span>]
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>Shape</code> will typically represent a puzzle piece, but it can represent any chunk
of voxels. We'll use it below to represent a set of pieces lumped together.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility-matters">Compatibility Matters</h2>
<p>Ok, moving on. Let's recall what we are after: we need to find a way to fit 25
pieces in the box simultaneously. In other words, we're looking for a
subcollection of <code>allValidPieces</code> that has 25 elements, such that no two
elements interpenetrate one another. Which begs the question: what does it mean,
formally, for two shapes to interpenetrate one another?</p>
<p>Recall that we represented a piece as the list of voxels that compose it. Two
shapes, then, are in conflict when they have at least one voxel in common — in
other words, when there is any voxel from the first that is also an element of
the second:</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-haskell "><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">conflict </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">:: Shape -&gt; Shape -&gt; Bool
</span><span>conflict shape1 shape2 = any (\voxel -&gt; elem voxel shape2) shape1
</span></code></pre>
<p>At this point, I'd say we're finally done modeling the problem and can start
looking for a solution!</p>
<p>25 pieces is a lot, we can't just repeatedly pick lists of 25 pieces until we
come across one where pieces happen to not conflict with one another. We need to
build our solution step by step, and for that, we need a way to find out what
pieces are compatible with a collection of pieces already in place. Out of
performance concerns, we won't encode the collection of pieces already in place
using a list of <code>Shape</code>s, but we'll lump them all together in one single
<code>Shape</code> composed of the voxels that are already occupied by some piece:</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-haskell "><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">newCompatiblePieces </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">:: Shape   </span><span style="color:#65737e;">-- ^ Voxels to avoid
</span><span>                    </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">-&gt;</span><span> [</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">Shape</span><span>] </span><span style="color:#65737e;">-- ^ All pieces that do not conflict with the input shape
</span><span>newCompatiblePieces occupiedVoxels =
</span><span>  filter
</span><span>    (\candidatePiece -&gt; not $ conflict candidatePiece occupiedVoxels)
</span><span>    allValidPieces
</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that in the above function, we are looking for all pieces that do not
conflict with the input, but the pieces in the output list will generally
conflict with one another. That's not a problem: the output list should not be
seen as a list of pieces to add, but as a list of <em>options</em> which we can choose
from.</p>
<p>Of course, some of the potentially compatible pieces we find, while they do not
directly conflict with any piece already in place, will lead to a dead-end
nevertheless: there is no solution compatible with both the pieces in place and
the new piece. That's actually kind of the point of our puzzle!: we can't solve
it just by adding piece after piece as long as they fit.</p>
<p>With an imperative apprach, we'd deal with this problem using explicit
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking">backtracking</a>, keeping track, at
each step, of the pieces we've tried, and going back one step whenever we don't
find what we're looking for. This is hard to think about! In Haskell, we
have a cheat code, and that's called:</p>
<h2 id="parallel-universes-with-the-list-monad">Parallel Universes with the <code>List</code> Monad</h2>
<p>I like to think of monads and <code>do</code> notation as a way for the programmer to pretend
they have access to a pure value when they don't actually. In the <code>IO</code> monad,
writing <code>userInput &lt;- getLine</code> is a way to pretend you have a value of type
<code>String</code>, even though you need to wait for <code>getLine</code> to be executed at runtime
for the value to actually be defined. In the <code>Maybe</code> monad, writing
<code>result &lt;- someComputation</code> is a way to pretend that <code>someComputation</code> yielded
a normal value, which you can access under the name <code>result</code>, even though
<code>someComputation</code> might be <code>Nothing</code> — in which case the whole <code>do</code> block becomes
<code>Nothing</code>.</p>
<p>Enter the <code>List</code> monad (also known as the <code>[]</code> monad, but that's harder to
pronounce). If <code>someList</code> is a list of type <code>[a]</code>, you can write
<code>value &lt;- someList</code> and proceed as though <code>value</code> were an actual value of type
<code>a</code>, even though there may be zero or more than one elements in the list.
What mechanism makes that possible? When you write <code>value1 &lt;- someList1</code>, the
universe <em>splits into several parallel subuniverses</em>, and everything you write
under that line in the do block is computed/executed as many times as there are
elements in <code>someList1</code>. If you write <code>value2 &lt;- someList2</code> below that, <em>each
of those parallel universes splits into parallel universes again</em>, one for each
element of <code>someList2</code>. If you're not careful, the number of branches can explode
quickly!</p>
<p>With that in mind, we can implement our function that recursively looks for
<em>subsolutions</em> of the puzzle: lists of <em>n</em> compatible pieces (for some input <em>n</em>
between 0 and 25) that do not conflict with a collection of pieces (again,
lumped together into a single <code>Shape</code>) assumed to already be in place:</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-haskell "><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">subsolutions </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">:: Int   </span><span style="color:#65737e;">-- ^ How many pieces should be in the subsolution we&#39;re looking for?
</span><span>             </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">-&gt; Shape </span><span style="color:#65737e;">-- ^ Unavailable voxels, already occupied by some piece
</span><span>             </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">-&gt;</span><span> [[</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">Shape</span><span>]] </span><span style="color:#65737e;">-- ^ List of subsolutions, each of which is itself a list of pieces
</span><span>subsolutions </span><span style="color:#d08770;">0</span><span> _ = [</span><span style="color:#d08770;">[]</span><span>]
</span><span>subsolutions n occupiedVoxels = </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">do
</span><span>  newPiece &lt;- filter
</span><span>                (\piece -&gt; not (conflict occupiedVoxels piece))
</span><span>                allValidPieces
</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">let</span><span> updatedOccupiedVoxels = newPiece &lt;&gt; occupiedVoxels
</span><span>  otherPieces &lt;- subsolutions (n - </span><span style="color:#d08770;">1</span><span>) updatedOccupiedVoxels
</span><span>  return $ newPiece : otherPieces
</span></code></pre>
<p>The base case is <em>n</em> = 0: there is exactly one solution with zero pieces, that's
the list with no piece in it. Now look at what happens in the other branch:</p>
<ul>
<li>We look for candidate pieces (on the right of the first <code>&lt;-</code>), that is, pieces
that do not conflict with our list of occupied voxels;</li>
<li>Using the magical <code>&lt;-</code> symbol, we split the universe into as many parallel
universes as there are candidate pieces; in each subuniverse, <code>newPiece</code>
will be defined to be the corresponding candidate piece;</li>
<li>In each parallel universe, we perform a recursive call, looking for the list
of subsolutions that are compatible with both the original list of occupied
voxels and our new piece;</li>
<li>Again, we split each universe into many parallel subuniverses, one for each
of those subsolutions;</li>
<li>For each universe, we return the resulting subsolution. The actual result is
a list with one value for each universe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you might think &quot;gosh, that's <em>a lot</em> of universes to split into, how is my
computer ever going to deal with those?&quot;, and you'd be right. There are two
reasons for hope, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some combinations of pieces will not allow for any new piece to be fit into
the box. In that case, the corresponding list of subsolutions will be empty,
which means that instead of splitting the corresponding universe into
subuniverses, the whole branch will die off. In other words, sometimes the
total number of universes will decrease.</li>
<li>Non-strict evaluation! This is all implemented with Haskell's lazy list type.
This means that as long as you're not trying to print the whole list of
solutions, not all parallel universes will actually be explored. Typically,
you'll want to print only the first element of the list of solutions, in
which case your program will stop as soon as it's found one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, the final list of solutions (there may be more than one!) to our problem
is then:</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-haskell "><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">allSolutions </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">::</span><span> [[</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">Shape</span><span>]]
</span><span>allSolutions = subsolutions </span><span style="color:#d08770;">25 []
</span></code></pre>
<p>and we get an arbitrary solution by taking the first element of the list with
<code>head</code>.</p>
<p>Alas, my computer hangs and never returns a value. It seems that we were too
careless splitting the universe many times, and the computer can't handle the
resulting combinatorial explosion. Honestly, this isn't too surprising. Our
approach is as bruteforce as it gets — which is actually good for a first
approach: as Donald Knuth puts it,
<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">&quot;premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>Ok, but what now? I guess we'll need to dig into optimization literature, or
maybe turn the problem into a SAT formula and fire up a SAT solver... Just
kidding! We're still going to bruteforce our problem, we just need to be smarter
about it.</p>
<h2 id="a-slightly-smarter-solution">A Slightly Smarter Solution</h2>
<p>We don't need to look far, in the way we built our final list of solutions, to
find sources of redundancy — (sub)solutions that are equivalent to one another,
but are nevertheless registered separately. For two given compatible piece
dispositions <code>piece1</code> and <code>piece2</code>, for instance, <code>[piece1, piece2]</code> and
<code>[piece2, piece1]</code> count as two subsolutions, even though they obviously
represent the same situation. The search will be performed once for each, and
if it leads nowhere, well... too bad, you will have wasted twice as much time.
And this will be true for any combination of compatible pieces, at any recursive
call. No wonder the algorithm is inefficient!</p>
<p>So, how are we to reduce the search space? Well, assume that you have a
subsolution and you're looking for a piece to add to it in order to get closer
to the full solution. Now take any free voxel <code>freeVoxel</code>, that is, any voxel
that is not part of any of the subsolution's pieces. Since we ultimately want
to fill the 5x5x5 cube, we know for sure that the full solution will feature a
piece that contains <code>freeVoxel</code>. So we can restrict our search to only pieces
that do!</p>
<p>Let's first implement a function that picks any free voxel in the box. We just
define a list composed of all of the box's voxels, filter out those that are
contained in one of the pieces in place, and take the first element of the
filtered list using <code>head</code>:</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-haskell "><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">pickFreeVoxel </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">:: Shape -&gt; V3 Int
</span><span>pickFreeVoxel alreadyOccupiedVoxels =
</span><span>  head $
</span><span>  filter (\voxel -&gt; not $ elem voxel alreadyOccupiedVoxels) $
</span><span>  [</span><span style="color:#d08770;">V3</span><span> x y z | x &lt;- [</span><span style="color:#d08770;">1</span><span>..</span><span style="color:#d08770;">5</span><span>], y &lt;- [</span><span style="color:#d08770;">1</span><span>..</span><span style="color:#d08770;">5</span><span>], z &lt;- [</span><span style="color:#d08770;">1</span><span>..</span><span style="color:#d08770;">5</span><span>]]
</span></code></pre>
<p>It isn't hard, now, to modify our <code>subsolutions</code> function so that it implements
our &quot;smarter&quot; bruteforce algorithm:</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-haskell "><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">subsolutionsSmart </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">:: Int   </span><span style="color:#65737e;">-- ^ How many pieces should be in the subsolution we&#39;re looking for?
</span><span>                  </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">-&gt; Shape </span><span style="color:#65737e;">-- ^ Unavailable voxels, already occupied by some piece
</span><span>                  </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">-&gt;</span><span> [[</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">Shape</span><span>]]
</span><span>subsolutionsSmart </span><span style="color:#d08770;">0</span><span> _ = [</span><span style="color:#d08770;">[]</span><span>]
</span><span>subsolutionsSmart n occupiedVoxels = </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">do
</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">let</span><span> freeVoxel = pickFreeVoxel occupiedVoxels
</span><span>  newPiece &lt;- filter
</span><span>                  (\piece -&gt; elem freeVoxel piece &amp;&amp;
</span><span>                             not (conflict occupiedVoxels piece)
</span><span>                  )
</span><span>                  allValidPieces
</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">let</span><span> updatedOccupiedVoxels = newPiece &lt;&gt; occupiedVoxels
</span><span>  otherPieces &lt;- subsolutionsSmart (n - </span><span style="color:#d08770;">1</span><span>) updatedOccupiedVoxels
</span><span>  return $ newPiece : otherPieces
</span></code></pre>
<p>The only change is that each time we're looking for a new piece, we pick a
<code>freeVoxel</code> and filter out pieces that don't contain it. Note that while
<code>newPiece</code> is on the left of a left arrow <code>&lt;-</code>, because we want to be
considering <em>all</em> pieces in the list, <code>freeVoxel</code> is defined using a normal
<code>let</code> assignment. That's because, even though <em>any</em> free voxel will do, we only
want to consider one.</p>
<p>And finally, to get the full list of solutions, we do exactly the same as above:</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-haskell "><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">allSolutionsSmart </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">::</span><span> [[</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">Shape</span><span>]]
</span><span>allSolutionsSmart = subsolutionsSmart </span><span style="color:#d08770;">25 []
</span></code></pre>
<p>We only want one solution, so we print the first element (or <code>head</code>) of that
list, and we measure the time it takes:</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-haskell "><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">main </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">:: IO </span><span>()
</span><span>main = </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">do
</span><span>  startTime &lt;- getCurrentTime
</span><span>  print $ head allSolutionsSmart
</span><span>  endTime &lt;- getCurrentTime
</span><span>  putStrLn $ &quot;</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">Found in </span><span>&quot; &lt;&gt;
</span><span>             show (realToFrac (diffUTCTime endTime startTime) :: </span><span style="color:#d08770;">Double</span><span>) &lt;&gt;
</span><span>             &quot;</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;"> seconds.</span><span>&quot;
</span></code></pre>
<p>And my computer does find a solution, in a little more than 30 minutes!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I don't have a moral to this story, it was just a fun case study. But here are
three suggestions of ways the program could be improved.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Optimization. On the one hand, the fact that a bruteforcing approach was able
to find us a solution at all is pretty nice. On the other hand, 30 minutes is
still quite a long time! The algorithm could probably be optimized, for instance
by favoring subsolutions that are more &quot;compact&quot;, for some definition of &quot;compact&quot;...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you run the program at home, the output you'll get is a frankly illegible
list of lists of vector values that look like <code>V3 2 4 1</code>. I was able to test my
solution in practice by manually drawing the corresponding pieces, and then packing the pieces
according to my drawing, but I won't lie, the process was pretty tedious. So
another possible improvement could be to find a way to pretty-print the solution(s)
the algorithm finds. It's not obvious how to do so, especially with text output!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, you might want to get all possible solutions, and for that,
to get rid of solutions that are rotated and/or mirrored versions of other
solutions. Better yet, you could try to avoid generating them in the first
place (in the same   way that we found a trick to avoid generating solutions
that were the same up to a rearrangement of the piece order).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to tell me if you make progress on either front!</p>
